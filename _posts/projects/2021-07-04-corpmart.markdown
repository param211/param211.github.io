## Introduction
Corpmart is a platform to buy and sell "businesses". People who want to exit their business can list their business on corpmart and prospective buyers can browse these listed businesses.

Buying and selling a business isn't as simple as buying a product on an ecommerce store, with a ton of paperwork and verification issues. Corpmart makes this process simpler.

We (team of three developers) were approached by a chartered accountant duo through mutual acquaintances. They had experience in buying and selling businesses offline and had come with the idea of taking it online, during the coronavirus pandemic.

The three of us had split work amongst ourselves. I was responsible for developing the backend along with the API.

## Developement
The backend was made in Python using the Django Framework, with the REST APIs being made with DjangoRest Framwork.

PostgreSQL was used as the realtional database beacuse of its compatibility with Django. The production instance was deployed on Google Cloud using their App Engine offering.

### Some notable challenges:
* OTP Login
	It was decided that the only medium of login should be via 5 digit one time passwords. Implementing this was particulary difficult since Django is highly opinionated towards the traditional email id - password system. The absence of any libraries meant that the user profile generation had to be overridden and custom otp generation and verification logic and endpoints were implemented.
* SMS notifications
	Along with the OTP, the clients required that whenever a business purchase request was made or a query was asked through the chatbot, an immediate sms notification should go to the site admin. This was implemented through third party sms providers, through APIs.
